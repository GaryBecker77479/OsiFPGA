Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:160 - CLKFB pin of DCM symbol "DCM_inst" is driven by pin CLKFX180
   of DCM symbol "DCM_inst". Proper phase relationship to the original clock
   cannot be guaranteed if the driver is not an IBUF or BUFGMUX. Timing analysis
   results may not be valid.

WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator GLB6502/mcode/Mmux_Jump_mux0008_3
   failed to merge with F5 multiplexer GLB6502/mcode/Mmux_Jump_mux0015_2_f5. 
   There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal
   timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator DATA_IN<0>231 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer DATA_IN<4>170_SW1.  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The

WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator COM1_EN_cmp_eq0000_SW3 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer COM1_EN_cmp_eq000021_SW2.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net COM1/TX_CLK_X is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

   on the CLKFB pin of comp DCM_inst is not driven by an IOB or BUFGMUX
   therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN cannot be
   guaranteed.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
